#Intercultural Gakkou Web App#

Simple application which helps to study in Intercultural Institute of Japan
Unfortunately they don't have proper infrastructure for people who want use laptops during studying, so this app should make your study process more easy, at least i hope so.


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

However this is a simple django application, there is no description for average user how to use, i will add it later.
